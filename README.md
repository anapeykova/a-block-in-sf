# A Block in San Francisco
<em>Digital Humanities Practicum for AH162 @Minerva Univesiry</em>

## Intro

In this project, I'm playing around with data from the 1900 San Francisco census, focusing on the residents of a single block in the city.

You can find the website live on https://a-block-in-sf.vercel.app/.

## Stack
<ul>
<li>html
<li>CSS + Bootstrap5
<li>JS, JQuery
<li>Plot.js & D3.js through Observable notebooks
</ul>

## The project
The website, as it is right now, is a bit scrappy and could use some work. When I have time, I'd like to revisit this project and work on the following:

### website
1. Build the maps from scratch using D3.js, instead of embedding notebooks from Observable.
2. Make maps zoom-able.
3. Clean up the html & CSS.
4. Improve mobile view. The website is responsive but some things break on smaller screens & zoom hover effect does not work with multitouch.

### content
1. Implement primary sources (images) instead of sketches.
2. Do some more research in available databases and make family paths more detailed.
