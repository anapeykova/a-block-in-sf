# A Block in San Francisco
<em>Digital Humanities Practicum for AH162 @Minerva Univesiry</em>

## Intro

In this project, I'm playing around with data from the 1900 San Francisco census, focusing on the residents of a single block in the city.

You can find the website live on https://a-block-in-sf.vercel.app/.

## Process
1. Digitizing data from census sheets from 1900, in collaboration with Lea Henaux.
2. Georeferencing locations using awesome-tables plugin in Google Sheets.
3. Plotting using D3.js/chart.js (?? to be decided)
4. Building the website.
