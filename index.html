            <li>
              For countries, Geocode picks the center as a point of reference,
              using modern day international borders. Due to limited information
              and changing borders, the points do not mark the precise place of
              birth but give a general location.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many of the residents were born in the same places, resulting in
              overlapping points. This makes the map hard to read and obscures
              the actual number of residents. To patch this issue, I implemented
              an element of randomness to the georeferenced coordinates, adding
              a random value between -1 and 1 to each. This makes for a
              negligible shift along the lattitude and longtitude of location
              and the point is still within the original country, capturing the
              place of birth with the same level of precision.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bohemia does not exist as a country anymore, and Geocode could not
              georeference it. In 1900, Bohemia's capital was Prague. I manually
              georeferenced Bohemia entries to point to Prague.
            </li>
            <li>
              I manually changed Russia's georeference to Moscow. Geocode placed
              Russia in Siberia (middle of the country), but my educated guess
              is that Russian immigrants came from the west of the country. On
              another note, Plot.js visualizes links between 2 points as the
              shortest path. The link between Siberia and the US (in the
              Connecting Families map) goes over the Pacific Ocean. This creates
              an inaccurate representation: the majority of immigrants reached the US through the Atlantic. Hence,
              "moving" Russia to Moscow makes the map a better historical
              representation.

    <p>The map above displays the birthplaces of the individuals residing in the block in 1900. You can adjust the time period by using the slider and get additional information on specific dots by hovering over them.</p>
    <p>One issue with this visualization is that the slider implies some dynamism, while the dots remain static. This arises from a lack of information, as we only have knowledge of the residents' birthplaces and their location in July 1900. The time in between remains uncertain. Although the census contains the year of immigration to the US for some of those born outside the country, it does not capture their point of entry. We can fill in some gaps through inductive reasoning.</p>
    <p>The 1900 census provides both <em>explicit</em> and <em>implicit</em> data about the block's inhabitants. Explicit data refers to information that is readily provided either by the census official (Archie L. Hyde), such as address, or by the individuals themselves upon inquiry, such as name, place and year of birth, occupation, etc. Implicit data is anything else that can be inferred from the data. For example, based on a resident's month of birth, we can deduce their zodiac sign (did you notice on the map above?) Although this may not reveal much, it serves as a useful example of <em>deductive</em> inference from the available data.
    </p>
    <p><em>Inductive</em> reasoning is more likely to produce erroneous conclusions but is also potentially more enlightening when working with census data. Based on occupation and location, we can infer annual income; based on country of origin, we can infer about religious and cultural belonging; and so on.</p>
    <p>Going back to the map above, we can track families's locations throughout the years based on their children's place and year of birth.</p>

        <li>I organized residents into families, based on (in order of consideration) relationship to household head, last name, marital status, gender and year of birth.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>A family consists of "head" (typically male but can be a widowed woman), "wife", "son", "daughter". Other relationships like "nephew", "step-daughter" or "brother-in-law" are also considered part of the family.</li>
            <li>The 1900 census data assumes there can be only one head for each household. If there are 2 or more families living under the same roof, only one family (presumably the house owners) are listed as family members. All others are marked as "lodgers".</li>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>I used the combination of last names, gender and marital status to inductively determine couples. For example, two consecutive entries with the same last name, both married, one male and one female and with an age difference of less than 15 years are likely a couple. This inductive inference rests on 2 assumptions: (1) only heterosexual marriages were legal in 1900, and (2) wives would adopt their husband's last name.</li>
              <li>Extending one the above, I used last names and parents' place of birth along with year of birth and sex to determine sons and daughters in the family.</li>
              <li>It is possible, of course, that the "children" are nephews or the adults are not married but have coinciding last names. My assumptions are made following the Occam's razor principle, favoring the simplest possible explanation.</li>
              <li>For transparency, I preserved the "lodger" label along with the presumed role in the family. For example, L. Landram is marked "lodger, likely wife" </li>
            </ol>
           <li>I gave each family an integer code. Single individuals with no assumed family belonging are marked as separate famililes.</li>

        </li>
        <li>I filtered out families with less than 3 members, excluding single people and married couples with no children living with them.</li>
        <li>I plotted families known locations using the georeferenced places of birth and year of birth, assuming the father was present for the birth of each child (it is logically necessary the mother was present).</li>

        <ul>
          <li>French-born taxidermist Ernest Lorquin lived in 1195 Market St. Where was his shop?</li>
          <li>The 1900 census data alone allows us to track families locations throughout the years, but we can do the same for individuals by combining multiple sources. Can you map John Spade's journey from Russia to 1139 Market St?</li>
          <li>Margaret Raleigh, mother of 3 and head of the 652 Stevenson St household, was born at sea in May 1855. Why would it be harder to track down her family's voyage to the US (for example, compared to John Spade's)?</li>
